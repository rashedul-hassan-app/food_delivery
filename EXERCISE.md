# Deliveroo Frontend Pairing Interview

This repository will be the base for your pairing interview. It contains a simple React application which is ready-to-go, meaning you shouldn't have to do any boilerplate copy/paste. Your interviewer will instruct you on how to proceed during the interview.

## Before your interview

### Installation

You should have been given this repository ahead of time to make sure you can run everything and have familiarized yourself with the code. To get started you will need the correct node version (see `.node-version`) installed, along with NPM. Then you can do:

```bash
npm install
```

You should now have your dependencies installed. To check your repo is working run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will see some console output listing a localhost address - go there in your browser and you should see a bare-bones "Deliverview" restaurant listing page.

### Tests

Different teams use different testing platforms at Deliveroo, so we're indifferent to which you use. To that end we have set up React Testing Library, which you can find a basic test pre-configured in the `tests/` folder. You can run this command to run all tests located within that directory:

```bash
npm test
```

Ensure you can run your preferred test suite before your interview.

## During the interview

Your interviewer will instruct you as to what task you will be performing throughout the interview. There may be several stages to this, so make sure you think about how you structure your work to make life easier for you later.

> **Note:** The folder structure and design decisions made in this repository are intentionally vague; when extending this repository during your interview, you should do whatever you feel is best.
